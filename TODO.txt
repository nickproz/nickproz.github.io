Top Priority:
- Font sizes to rem
- Extract colors and sizes into variables (clean up code)
- Experience tiles clickable indicator (company name banner with > arrow?)
- Remove jquery-ui if not needed

Bugs:
- 1 pixel above nav bar
- Flicker on sides of experience tiles on hover
- Page load background blue color flashes
- Paragraphs don't wrap and we are forced to manually break the line
- Race condition when loading a page that has a hash to a new section (hash resets to home but doesn't scroll to section)

Eventually:
- Vertically center experience tile modal images
- Experience tile design
- Theme colors
- iPad landscape responsiveness
- Everything to flex

To Consider:
- Add headings for each section?
- Experience tiles to use semantic grid columns maybe?
- Picture and about description on top of one another at all viewports?
- Getting rid of bower and just using npm?

Resume:
- Make name blue?
- Consider adding citation for supercomputing paper
- Add some non-coding skills?
- Combine Desk clerk bullet points into one if more space is needed
- Combine Grader second and third bullet points into one if more space is needed
