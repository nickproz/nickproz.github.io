Top Priority:
- Font sizes to rem
- Extract colors and sizes into variables (clean up code)
- Experience tiles clickable indicator (company name banner with > arrow?)

Bugs:
- 1 pixel above nav bar
- Flicker on sides of experience tiles on hover
- Page load background blue color flashes

Eventually:
- Vertically center experience tile modal images
- Experience tile design
- Theme colors
- iPad landscape responsiveness
- Everything to flex

To Consider:
- Add headings for each section?
- Experience tiles to use semantic grid columns maybe?
- Picture and about description on top of one another at all viewports?
